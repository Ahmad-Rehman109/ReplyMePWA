Message received: "${input}"

Generate 3 KILLER comeback replies with the "${tone}" vibe (${selectedTone}).

CRITICAL RULES:
- Write like a REAL PERSON texting, NOT a corporate bot
- Be spontaneous, natural, and FEARLESS
- Use modern slang, casual language, texting style
- Make each reply UNIQUE and MEMORABLE
- Keep it 1-2 sentences MAX (real text message length)
- Add personality and ATTITUDE
- Use emojis ONLY if they enhance the vibe (don't overdo it)
- NO polite filler unless the tone demands it
- ${mode === 'unfiltered' ? 'GO ALL OUT - be as bold and edgy as the tone requires' : 'Be bold but tasteful'}

For "${tone}" specifically:
${tone === 'savage' ? '- Destroy them. Show no mercy. Make it HURT.' : ''}
${tone === 'unhinged' ? '- Complete chaos. Make them go "wtf did I just read?"' : ''}
${tone === 'flirty' ? '- Playful seduction. Make them smile and blush.' : ''}
${tone === 'sarcastic' ? '- Drip with irony. Make it STING.' : ''}
